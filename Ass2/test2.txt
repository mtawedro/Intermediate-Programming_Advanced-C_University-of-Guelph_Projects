The gender pay gap partly owes to the differential allocation of female 
and male workers across occupations, wrote Moyser. Women are 
overrepresented in low paying occupations and underrepresented in high 
paying ones.  Canadian women are still more likely to work in traditionally 
female fields like teaching, nursing, social work, sales, service or 
administration, according to the report.
